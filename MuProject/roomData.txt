0;Inside Car;You sit in your trusty Ford Taurus. It smells faintly of cigarettes, greasy fast food lunches, and the fatigue that comes with a decade on the force. The car has seen some better days, with chipped finish and peeling pleather, but overall, it still runs well and gets you where you need to go. Honestly, it's home.;-1;-1;-1;2;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
1;The Countryside;You stand on the driveway leading out to the country road that brings you to the Summerworth Estate. It feels unseasonably cold, even for November, and a thick fog covers and largely obscures the moor-like landscape. Trees loom in the distance like silent guardians, holding an unknowable vigil.;2;-1;0;-1;-1;-1;0;0;0;0;0;
2;Driveway;The air is thick with palpable dread, the fog is heavy and obscures almost everything leading up to the stately Summerworth Mansion. The trees, recently denuded of leaves, cast an eerie presence along the driveway.;3;1;-1;0;-1;-1;0;0;0;0;0;
3;The Porch;You are standing on the front porch of the stately Summerworth Mansion. The style is decidedly restored Victorian, with much of the original woodwork and framing replaced with painstakingly detailed replicas. In fact, it all looks entirely too new. You feel no respite from the cold or bone-chilling of the fog here.;4;2;34;36;-1;-1;0;0;0;0;0;
4;Foyer;The foyer, even though well lit, holds a certain gloom. The details of the architecture are exquisite and recently updated. A grand staircase leads upstairs, while a large archway leads to the rest of the house.;5;3;-1;-1;19;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
5;South Corridor;The southern end of the main corridor of the first floor of the house. Pictures of the family line the walls.;8;4;-1;6;-1;-1;1;0;1;0;0;

7;Living Room;A comfortable living room, it feels strangely devoid of any of the family warmth you expect. In fact, there is a sense of dread and gravity here that is completely out of place.;-1;6;8;-1;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
8;Middle Corridor;The middle part of the main corridor. A few pictures seem to be missing.;14;5;7;9;-1;-1;1;1;0;0;0;
9;Eerie Bathroom;The bathroom is suitably understated, and obviously meant for the guests. It still has a certain level of luxury and beauty though. The Victorian style continues in here. (On the wall, there is a strange writing.);-1;-1;-1;8;-1;-1;1;1;0;0;0;
10;Kitchen;A beautifully remodelled kitchen, immaculately clean, and modernized.;11;-1;6;13;-1;13;0;0;0;0;0;

15;Study;A vague odor of sandalwood fills the room. The study is cozy and nicely appointed. You could easily take a moment to relax here, but the pervasive sense of dread removes any feelings of lingering.;17;-1;16;14;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
16;Hidden Room;At the end of the hall, this room feels somehow disconnected from the rest of the world. You almost feel like gravity is a bit off here. The shadows also seem far too deep and menacing to be natural.;-1;14;-1;-1;-1;4;1;1;1;0;0;
17;Library;Rows of books line the walls. The panels are made of finely stained white oak and the floor is made from a well-cared for, but well worn timber. There is a faint musty odor.;-1;15;-1;-1;-1;-1;1;1;0;0;0;
18;Mysterious Room;After passing by the panel, you enter a room that doesn't seem to fit anywhere in the house. In fact, it feels like you have stepped sideways into another dimension. The shadows seem longer and deeper and you feel like a thousand eyes are watching you. The room appears to be a perfect cube, and all the surfaces are plain white.;-1;14;4;-1;-1;-1;1;1;1;0;0;
19;Second Floor Landing;Standing at the top of the stairs, you recognize the living quarters of the home. The walls are papered in an understated paper, with muted patterns and a cream color. The carpet is a light blue, soft ply.;20;-1;-1;-1;30;4;1;0;0;0;0;

23;Master Bedroom;The first thing that greets you is the odor, followed by the sight of blood smeared across the walls and floors. The sense of foreboding is very strong here.;-1;22;-1;24;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
24;Master Bath;Despite the horrific mess in the other room, this room is like much of the rest of the house, immaculately clean.;-1;-1;23;-1;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;

27;Sarah's Bedroom;The room looks like it hasn't had anyone stay for awhile, and everything is in its proper place. There is a sense of ease and peace here, that is absent from the rest of the home. Still, that lingering dread can be felt here.;26;-1;28;-1;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;
28;Shared Bathroom;The bathroom between Sarah and Caleb's rooms. It has a soothing periwinkle flower patterend wallpaper. There are some shavings in the sink, implying it had recently been used.;-1;-1;25;27;-1;-1;1;0;0;0;0;

30;Attic Landing;The foot of the attic. You can see dust motes floating through the air. The air is musty and thick here, and the shadow seem to reach out towards you.;32;-1;-1;31;-1;19;1;1;0;0;0;

33;Ritual Room;The sense of dread is the strongest in here. The room is small, and covered in strange runes. It seems to be growing in size. You feel disoriented, and can almost hear obscene whispers in some arcane language.;-1;-1;-1;32;-1;-1;1;0;1;0;0;
34;West Garden;This part of the garden has a mature copse of trees and rows of woody shrubbery and rose bushes.;35;-1;3;-1;-1;-1;0;0;0;0;0;
