Welcome to Summerworth Manor!

You are a hardened private detective, known for getting your hands dirty where others 
wont. Peter and Abigail Summerworth, heirs to the infamous Summerworth Manor, have been 
murdered in ghastly fashion and the local police are unable or unwilling to make progress 
in their investigation.  

You have been hired to pick up where the cops left off. You've heard the rumours of the 
foul cult that practised ghoulish, bloody rituals within the manor almost a century ago, 
but these ghost stories come often in your line of work. Still, the dossier briefing the 
cops gave you stood out as gruesome even compared to the filing cabinet stuffed with grim 
cases back at your office.  You have three leads on suspects to begin your investigation:

Caleb Summerworth, Peter and Abigail's only son and heir.

Alfred the gardner, long time caretaker of the manor's expansive grounds
and legendary hedge maze.

Mr. Brown, the family Valet.

As you pull your car up to the estate, recalling the photographs of the murder scene and
victims in the dossier on the seat next to you is enough to give you the willies even in the 
afternoon countryside sun...
